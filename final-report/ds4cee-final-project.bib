	abstract = {Current research suggests that, apart from photochemical reactions, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (TEX) removal from ambient air might be affected by atmospheric precipitation, depending on the concentrations and water solubility of the compounds, Henry's law, physico-chemical properties of the water, as well as the frequency and intensity of precipitation events. Nevertheless, existing knowledge of the role that wet deposition plays in biogeochemical cycles of volatile species remains insufficient, and this topic requires more scientific effort to be explored and understood. In this study, we employed the eXtreme Gradient Boosting tree ensemble for revealing TEX transfer from ambient air to rainwater, and applied a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations feature attribution framework to examine the relevance of the monitored parameters and identify key factors that govern wet deposition of TEX. According to the results, main impacts, including ambient air TEX concentrations, and rainwater and air temperatures, and occasional, but less important impacts, including wind speed, air pressure, turbidity, and total organic carbon, NO3−, Cl− and K+ rainwater concentration, shaped TEX partition between gaseous and aqueous phases during rain events.},

@article{Jiang:2021,
	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNN) has been considered as an attractive modelling method for molecular property prediction, and numerous studies have shown that GNN could yield more promising results than traditional descriptor-based methods. In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles. All in all, we believe that the off-the-shelf descriptor-based models still can be directly employed to accurately predict various chemical endpoints with excellent computability and interpretability.},

@article{RN106,
	abstract = {Methods for dimensionality reduction are showing significant contributions to knowledge generation in high-dimensional modeling scenarios throughout many disciplines. By achieving a lower dimensional representation (also called embedding), fewer computing resources are needed in downstream machine learning tasks, thus leading to a faster training time, lower complexity, and statistical flexibility. In this work, we investigate the utility of three prominent unsupervised embedding techniques (principal component analysis---PCA, uniform manifold approximation and projection---UMAP, and variational autoencoders---VAEs) for solving classification tasks in the domain of toxicology. To this end, we compare these embedding techniques against a set of molecular fingerprint-based models that do not utilize additional pre-preprocessing of features. Inspired by the success of transfer learning in several fields, we further study the performance of embedders when trained on an external dataset of chemical compounds. To gain a better understanding of their characteristics, we evaluate the embedders with different embedding dimensionalities, and with different sizes of the external dataset. Our findings show that the recently popularized UMAP approach can be utilized alongside known techniques such as PCA and VAE as a pre-compression technique in the toxicology domain. Nevertheless, the generative model of VAE shows an advantage in pre-compressing the data with respect to classification accuracy.},

@article{matthies,
	abstract = {General public concern over the effects of persistent chemicals began in the early 1960s. Since then, significant scientific advances have increased our understanding of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals and the properties and processes that influence their fates in, and adverse effects on, human health and the environment. In addition to the scientific advances, a number of legislations and agreements for national, international, and global identification and control of PBT chemicals have been adopted. However, some of the rationales and thoughts that were relied upon when the first criteria were developed to identify and categorize PBT chemicals and then POPs (persistent organic pollutants) have not been carried forward. Criteria have been based upon available data of neutral hydrophobic substances as reference chemicals, derived under laboratory conditions. They evolved over the last decades due to the diversification of the protection aims under various national regulatory frameworks and international agreements, advances in methods for estimation of physical/chemical properties, and the identification of chemicals which are non-traditional POPs. Criteria are not defined purely by science; they also are subject to the aims of policy. This paper offers a historical perspective on the development of criteria for PBT chemicals and POPs. It also offers suggestions for rationalization of protection goals, describes some emerging procedures for identification of compounds of concern, and proposes information that needs to be considered when applying criteria to screening and/or evaluation of new chemicals. PBT and POP assessment criteria were developed from best science available from 1970 to 1990 and consensus-based policy discussions.},

@article{meylan,
	abstract = {Abstract Bond contribution values, used to estimate Henry's law constant (HLC) (air-to-water partition coefficient) from chemical structure, have been determined for 59 chemical bonds by a least-square analysis of known HLCs for 345 organic compounds. A correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.94 was determined for the relationship between known LWAPCs (log water-to-air partition coefficients) and bond estimated LWAPCs for the 345 compound data set. The correlation coefficient increases to 0.97 when quantified correction factors are applied to selected chemical classes. The ability of the bond method to estimate LWAPCs is demonstrated by a validation test set of 74 diverse and structurally complex compounds that were not included in the least-squares analysis. The correlation coefficient for the validation set is 0.96.},
